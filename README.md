*** INTRODUCTION ***

Welcome to my workout timer project!

This was a fun little coding project I completed right after taking my first computer science course. 
The code may be a little messy, but the timer runs fine!

This timer is equipped with a GUI that allows a use to input a workout manually, or navigate to a text
file of a given form that would do this. Check out some of the pre-defined workouts for more info 
on the format of input files.

*** FUNCTIONALITIES ***

1) Main Timer— a continous timer that can be paused and restarted without fail. This timer will switch between
   exercises when the time for a given exercise is up. This is the main functionality of the program.
   
2) Sound— this timer will beep at the end of each exercise and a long beep will sound at the entire workout

3) GUI— The graphical user interface allows for seamless use of the timer as explained in the introduction

4) Workout files— the timer allows for users to input workouts of a given form into the program. The code
   will parse through these files and input the workout
